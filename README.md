# fancy-bibli

Fancy bibli is a very simple application designed to navigate through a static library of files on a server.

## How do I pronounce that name

It's pronounced bee-blee

## Installation

Drop index.php and bibli-utils in the top-most folder of your library's hierarchy

## What's the point of this thing ?

Making a bunch of files stored on a web server easy to navigate and download, more pleasantly than using the default file explorer
